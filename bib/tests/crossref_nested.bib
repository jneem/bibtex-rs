Nested crossreferences aren't really allowed (so they create warnings),
and their behavior depends on the order that the entries appear.

@article{grandchild,
    crossref="child",
}

@article{child,
    title="Child title",
    crossref="parent",
}

@article{parent,
    author = "Parent author",
}

@article{parent2,
    author = "Parent author",
}

@article{child2,
    title="Child title",
    crossref="parent2",
}

@article{grandchild2,
    crossref="child2",
}
